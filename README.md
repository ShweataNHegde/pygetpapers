## history
`getpapers` is a tool written by Rik Smith-Unna funded by ContentMine at https://github.com/ContentMine/getpapers. The OpenVirus community has a need for a Python version and Ayush Garg has written a partial implemnatio from scratch, with some enhancements =. IOW (2021-03) `pygetpapers` does most of what `getpapers` does.
