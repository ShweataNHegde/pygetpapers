The demographic characteristics, laboratory parameters, and CVD readmission were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes included CVD mortality, infection-related mortality and technique failure. A logistic regression was used to identify the risk factors associated with CVD readmission within the first year after dialysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between CVD readmission and the outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 1589 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients were included in this study, of whom 120 (7.6%) patients had at least one episode of CVD readmission within the first year after dialysis initiation. Advanced age, CVD history, and a lower level of serum albumin were independently associated with CVD readmission. CVD readmission within the first year after dialysis was significantly associated with all-cause (HR 2.66, 95%CI 1.91-3.70, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and CVD (HR 3.42, 95%CI 2.20-5.31, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) mortality, but not infection-related mortality or technique failure, after adjusting for confounders.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings suggest that an advanced age, a history of CVD, and a lower level of serum albumin were independently associated with CVD readmission. Moreover, CVD readmission was associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in incident CAPD patients.", "affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Peritoneal dialysis", "risk factors", "Outcomes", "Cardiovascular Disease Readmission"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/0886022X.2020.1866009"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7808740"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7808740?pdf=render"}]}, "commentCorrectionList": {"commentCorrection": {"id": "33615983", "source": "MED", "reference": "Ren Fail. 2021 Dec;43(1):381", "type": "Erratum in", "orderIn": "1"}}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-01-14", "firstIndexDate": "2021-01-16", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-01-25", "dateOfRevision": "2021-02-22", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-12-01"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7808740", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7808740?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Renal failure", "authorinfo": "Li J", "title": "Risk factors and outcomes of cardiovascular disease readmission within the first year after dialysis in peritoneal dialysis patients."}
