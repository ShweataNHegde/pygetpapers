AI may contribute (i) to diagnosis and disease case detection, (ii) to more reliable predictions and reduced errors, (iii) to representing more realistically complex biological systems and rendering computing codes more readable to non-computer scientists, (iv) to speeding-up decisions and improving accuracy in risk analyses, and (v) to better targeted interventions and anticipated negative effects. In turn, challenges in AH may stimulate AI research due to specificity of AH systems, data, constraints, and analytical objectives. Based on a literature review of scientific papers at the interface between AI and AH covering the period 2009&#x02013;2019, and interviews with French researchers positioned at this interface, the present study explains the main AH areas where various AI approaches are currently mobilised, how it may contribute to renew AH research issues and remove methodological or conceptual barriers. After presenting the possible obstacles and levers, we propose several recommendations to better grasp the challenge represented by the AH/AI interface. With the development of several recent concepts promoting a global and multisectoral perspective in the field of health, AI should contribute to defract the different disciplines in AH towards more transversal and integrative research.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Animal disease</kwd><kwd>Data</kwd><kwd>Livestock</kwd><kwd>Modelling</kwd><kwd>Artificial intelligence</kwd><kwd>Decision support tool</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE32-0007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ezanno</surname><given-names>Pauline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H2020-SC1-BHC-2018-2019, Grant 874850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bailly</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>LABEX CEBA</institution></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-25-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu&#x000e9;gan</surname><given-names>Jean-Fran&#x000e7;ois</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF#1911457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu&#x000e9;gan</surname><given-names>Jean-Fran&#x000e7;ois</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses a large range of theories and technologies used to solve problems of high logical or algorithmic complexity. It crosses many disciplines, including mechanistic modelling, software engineering, data science, and statistics (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Introduced in the 1950s, many AI methods have been developed or extended recently with the improvement of computer performance. Recent developments have been fuelled by the interfaces created between AI and other disciplines, such as bio-medicine, as well as massive data from different fields, particularly those associated with healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Interactions between animal health (AH), artificial intelligence (AI), and closely related research domains.</bold> This illustration is pinpointing only the links between AH (in blue), AI and its main subfields (in red), and other related fields of research (in black). It can be naturally complexified through the interactions between AH and other research topics (e.g., human medicine) or between core disciplines (e.g., statistics and physics).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13567_2021_902_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">AI addresses three challenges that also make sense in animal health (AH): (1) understanding a situation and its dynamics, e.g., epidemic spread; (2) the perception of the environment, which corresponds in AH to the detection of patterns (e.g., repeated sequence of observations), forms (e.g., of a protein) and signals (e.g., increased mortality compared to a baseline) at different scales; (3) computer-based decision making, or, more realistically, human decision support (e.g., expert systems, diagnostic support, resource allocation).</p><p id="Par4">To answer these challenges, a wide range of concepts and methods are developed in AI. This includes machine learning (ML), a widely known AI method nowadays, which has been developing since the 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Since the 2000s, deep learning is developing with the rise of big data and the continuous increasing of computing capacities, enabling the exploration of massive amount of information that cannot be processed by conventional statistical methods. In addition, this also includes methods and algorithms for solving complex problems, automating tasks or reasoning, integrating information from heterogeneous sources, or decision support (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These methods are now uprising in the human health sector, but are still rarely used to study animal health issues that they would help to revisit.</p><p id="Par5">Part of the scientific challenges faced in AH can be approached from a new perspective by using some of these AI methods to analyse the ever-increasing data collected on animals, pathogens, and their environment. AH research benefits from advances in machine and deep learning methods, e.g., in predictive epidemiology, individual-based precision medicine, and to study host&#x02013;pathogen interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These methods contribute to disease diagnosis and individual case detection, to more reliable predictions and reduced errors, to speed-up decisions and improved accuracy in risk analysis, and to better targeting interventions in AH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. AH research also benefits from scientific advances in other domains of AI. Knowledge representation and modelling of reasoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] allow more realistic representations of complex socio-biological systems such as those encountered in AH. Examples include processes related to decision-making and uncertainty management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], as well as of patient life courses like in human epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This contributes to making them more readable by noncomputer experts. In addition, advances in problem solving under constrained resource allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], in autonomous agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], multi-agent systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and multi-level systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], as well as on automatic computer code generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] can be mobilised to enhance efficient and reliable epidemiological models. Interestingly, this may aid to anticipate the effect of control and management decisions at different spatial and temporal scales (animal, herd, country&#x02026;).</p><p id="Par6">Conducting research at the AH/AI interface also leads to identify new challenges for AI, on themes common with human health but considering different contexts and perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. First, taking into account the particular agro- and socio-economic conditions of production systems is crucial when dealing with AH. Animal production systems depend on human activities and decisions. They can be a source of income (e.g., livestock) or labour forces and source of food in family farming. Citizens have also high expectations in terms of ethics and animal welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Conventional measures to control animal diseases may no longer be acceptable by society (e.g., mass culling during outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], antimicrobial usage, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]). Alternatives must be identified and assessed, and AI can contribute. For example, individual-based veterinarian medicine is emerging, mobilising both AI methods and new AH data streams, these data differing from data in human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The integration of data from deep sequencing in AH, including emerging technologies for studying the metabolome and epigenome, is also a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Second, interactions between animal species, in particular between domestic animals and wildlife, lead to specific infectious disease risks (e.g., multi-host pathogens such as for African swine fever, pathogens crossing the species barrier facilitated by frequent contacts and promiscuity). The intensity of such interactions could increase due to separate or synergistic actions of environmental (e.g., landscape homogenisation, land use change for agriculture development, climate change), demographic (e.g., increasing global demand for animal production) and societal (e.g., outdoor livestock management) pressures. In addition, working on multi-species disease networks provides crucial information on the underlying molecular mechanisms favouring interspecific transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Third, animal populations are governed by recurrent decision-making that also impacts health management (e.g., trade, control measures). Economic criteria as consequences on livestock farmers&#x02019; incomes are therefore essential indicators for evaluating AH control strategies, which can sometimes be misunderstood or may be at odds with societal expectations. These specificities make the AH/AI interface a theme of interest to stimulate new methodological work and to solve some of old and current locks faced by AH research today. With the development of new concepts in health such as One Health, Ecohealth and Planetary Health, promoting multidisciplinarity, stakeholders&#x02019; participation, data sharing, and tackling the complexity of health issues (e.g., multi-host pathogen transmission, short and long-term climatic impacts on disease patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]), AI could participate in this new development by making it possible to technically solve some of the complex problems posed.</p><p id="Par7">Mobilising the literature published at the AH/AI interface between 2009 and 2019 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A), focusing our literature search on mainly livestock and wildlife, as well as interviews conducted with French researchers positioned at this interface (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>B), we identified the main research areas in AH in which AI is currently involved country-wide. We explored how AI methods contribute to revisiting AH questions and may help remove methodological or conceptual barriers within the field. We also analysed how AH questions interrogate and stimulate new AI technical or scientific developments. In this paper, we first discuss issues related to data collection, organisation and access (Section&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref>), then we discuss how AI methods contribute to revisiting our understanding of animal epidemiological systems (Section&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>), to improving case detection and diagnosis at different scales (Section&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref>), and to anticipating pathogen spread and control in a wide range of scenarios in order to improve AH management, facilitate decision-making and stimulate innovation (Section&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">4</xref>). Finally, we present the possible obstacles and levers to the development of AI in modern AH (Section&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">5</xref>), before making recommendations to best address the new challenges represented by this AH/IA interface (Section&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Collect, organise and make accessible quality data</title><p id="Par8">A central point for research in AH remains the quality and availability of data, at the different organization levels of living systems and therefore at different spatial and temporal scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Data of interest are diverse. They can be obtained thanks to molecular analysis (e.g., genomic, metagenomics, or metabolic data), from observational data on individuals (e.g., body temperature, behaviour, milk production and composition, weight, feed intake), or from the production system (e.g., herd structure, breeding, management of sanitary issues). They can also be obtained at larger scales, beyond herds or local groups of animals (e.g., epidemiological data, demographic events, commercial movements, meteorological data, land-use occupation).</p><p id="Par9">Even though the acquisition of these massive and heterogeneous data remain challenging (e.g., metabolome data), a large and diverse amount is already collected: (i) through mandatory reporting in accordance with regulations (e.g., commercial movements of cattle, epidemio-surveillance platform), (ii) by automatic devices (e.g., sensors, video surveillance systems), and (iii) on an ad hoc basis as part of research programs. This leads to a very wide diversity of data properties, and therefore of their management, access and possible uses. These data can be specifically obtained for certain animals or herds (e.g., during cohort monitoring programs) or by private companies (e.g., pig trade movements such as in France, milk collection). This can limit accessibility to academics and public research. Globalisation and large-scale animal trade may generate the need to use data obtained at worldwide scale in AH, especially for quantitative epidemiology (e.g., transcontinental spread of pathogens, animal genetics and breed management) leading to standardisation issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Consideration should be given to future systems for observing, collecting and managing these data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and to practices aimed at better collaboration between stakeholders. While data management has always been an important element in applied research to facilitate their use and valorisation, it is now a strategic issue both in theoretical and more applied research, coupled with a technical and algorithmic challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Indeed, producing algorithms to manage massive data flows and stocks, by optimising calculations, is a challenge, particularly in real time. It seems also necessary to make heterogeneous data sources interoperable, requiring dedicated methodological developments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition, much of the data is private, with ownership often heterogeneous (e.g., multiple owners, non-centralised data, closed data) and sometimes unclear (e.g., lack of knowledge of the real owner of the data between, for example, farmers, the data collector or the farmers&#x02019; union). All this tends to considerably complicate access to the data, raises questions about intellectual property, and raises questions in relation to regulations with regards to data protection, e.g., the adaptation of regulation to AH while respecting the confidentiality of the personal data mobilised. What is the relevant business model for data collection or access to existing databases? What about the openness of AH data (e.g., duality between the notion of public good and the private nature of certain data) to make it possible to experiment in real situations and compare the performance of AI algorithms? Answering these questions would facilitate the collection and sharing of ad hoc data. AI, particularly when combining a participatory framework with expert systems and multi-agent systems, helps to build realistic representations of complex socio-biological systems. Thus, it proves to be an effective tool to promote the collaboration of different stakeholders in collective and optimised decision-making, and to assess of the impact of changes in uses and practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Encouraging experimentation of AI technologies at a territorial scale becomes crucial to favour their development, validate their performance, and measure their predictive quality. In AH, simplified access to data-generating facilities would allow innovative solutions to be tested on a larger scale and would accelerate their development and evaluation. Substantial expertise exists (e.g., epidemiological data platform, large cohorts, experimental farms) that could be put to good use. In addition, AI could help to revisit sampling methods for field data collection in AH and epidemiological surveillance, by better and more dynamically targeting the data to be collected while avoiding redundant collinear, non-necessary data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Contribution of AI to better understand animal epidemiological systems</title><p id="Par12">Recent technological advances involving AI approaches have made it possible to obtain vast quantities of measurements and observations, as well as to store and share these data more efficiently. This has resulted in an increasing requirement for appropriate data analytical methods. AI methods emerged as the response of the computer-science community to these requirements, leveraging the exponential improvements in computational power. In parallel, statistical methods have greatly evolved in the last few decades as well, e.g., with regards to dimensionality-reduction in the spaces of variables and parameters, variable selection, and model comparison and combination. The rise in computational power has unleashed the development of Bayesian inference through simulation or approximate methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Bayesian methods have, in turn, facilitated the integration of data from diverse sources, the incorporation of prior knowledge and allowed for inference on more complex and realistic models while changing the paradigm of statistical inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Better understanding the evolution of AH and socio-ecological systems in a One Health context</title><p id="Par13">Learning methods can be used to do phylogenetic reconstructions, contributing in particular to new evolutionary scenarios of pathogens and their transmission pathways. For example, phylogenetic models offer an interesting perspective for identifying environmental bacterial strains with high infectious potentiality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], or for predicting the existence of putative host reservoirs or vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The analysis of pathogen sharing among hosts has been used to classify the potential reservoirs of zoonotic diseases using machine learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The analysis of pathogen genomes can also be used to identify genotypes of animal pathogens that are more likely to infect humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Using phenomenological niche models that rely on data distribution more than on hypotheses about ecological processes at play, disease occurrence data or retrospective serological data coupled with environmental variables can be related to the risk of being exposed to a pathogen. Thus, they can help monitor potential spillovers and emerging risks and anticipate the epidemic pathogen spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. For instance, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have identified the level of genetic introgression between wild and domesticated animal populations in a spatialized context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which may help to understand gene diffusion in host&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;pathogen systems involving multiple host species, and characterise specimen pools at higher risk to act as pathogen spreaders or sinks. Other AI approaches such as multi-agent models, a more mechanistic approach, have been used in an explicit spatial context for vector-borne pathogen transmissions, and proved to be sufficiently versatile to be adapted to several other particular contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">It should be noted here that several studies reveal the relatively ancient nature of AI research in AH. Such AI methods have often made it possible to identify signals (e.g., genetic introgression) or even particular patterns or properties (e.g., importance of density-dependence in the vector-borne transmission) that are less visible or hardly detectable by more conventional statistical treatments.</p><p id="Par16">All these approaches contribute to better understand pathogen transmission in complex system networks as generally observed for emerging infections in tropical, developing regions of the world. On this matter, an improved knowledge is key for protecting humans against these new threats, and AI/AH interfaces development and training in cooperation with the poorest countries would facilitate synergistic effects and actions to predict and tackle new disease threats.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Reliability, reproducibility and flexibility of mechanistic models in AH</title><p id="Par17">Better understanding and predicting pathogen spread often requires an explicit and integrative representation of the mechanisms involved in the dynamics of AH systems, irrespective of the scale (within-host: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]; along a primary production chain: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]; in a territory: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]; over a continent: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]).</p><p id="Par18">Mathematical (equations) or computer-based (simulations) models can be used. Such mechanistic models (i.e., which represent the mechanisms involved in the infection dynamics), when sufficiently modular to represent contrasted situations, make it possible to anticipate the effects of conventional but also innovative control measures (e.g., new candidate molecules, sensors, genomic selection; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]).</p><p id="Par19">However, to assess realistic control measures, mechanistic epidemiological models require the integration of observational data and knowledge from biology, epidemiology, evolution, ecology, agronomy, sociology or economics. Their development can rapidly face challenges of reliability, transparency, reproducibility, and usage flexibility. Moreover, these models are often developed de novo, making little use of previous models from other systems. Finally, these models, even based on realistic biological hypotheses, may be considered negatively as black boxes by end users (health managers), because the underlying assumptions often became hidden in the code or equations.</p><p id="Par20">The integration of multiple modelling perspectives (e.g., disciplines, points of view, spatio-temporal scales) is an important question in the modelling-simulation field.

Knowledge representation methods from symbolic AI, formalised using advanced software engineering methods such as domain-specific languages (DSL, e.g., in KENDRICK for differential equation models: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]), makes model components accessible in a readable structured text file instead of computer code.

Combining knowledge representation (through a DSL) and such a multi-level agent-based simulation architecture (e.g., in EMULSION, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]) enables to encompass several types of models (e.g., compartmental, individual-based) and scales (e.g., individual, population, territory), and it tackles simultaneously the recurring needs for transparency, reliability and flexibility in modelling contagious diseases.

Interface disciplines have developed, e.g., computational biology and immunology, which today must spread to AH. Current human immunology is based on the description of fine molecular and cellular mechanisms (e.g., the number of known interleukins has increased considerably compared to the 1970s). The desire to understand the processes underlying immune responses has led to a revolution by inviting this discipline to focus on complex systems biology and AI-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].

The potential of AI to grasp such diversity and complexity (e.g., tissue-specific microbiotes) and to scaling-up to higher levels of organization (e.g., component and compound communities of microbes, including pathogens, circulating in herd and in a given region) is certainly tremendous and should be studied with the same vigour as recent development in computational biology and immunology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Revisiting AH case detection methods at different scales</title><p id="Par26">Managing livestock health issues requires effective case detection methods, at the individual or even infra-individual (organ) scale, at the group/herd scale, or at larger scales (e.g., territories, countries). Machine learning methods allow detecting patterns and signals in massive data, e.g., in spatial data or time-series of health syndromes and disease cases, contributing to the development of smart agriculture and telemedicine (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Alerts can be produced, and contribute to management advice in numerical agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and veterinary practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. AI may contribute to an earlier detection of infected cases and the rationalisation of treatments (including antimicrobials) in farm animals, by analysing data collected from connected sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], by targeting individuals or groups of animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], or even by using mechanistic models to predict the occurrence of case detections and their treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].

Finally, therapeutic strategies can be reasoned through multi-criteria optimisation, by identifying whom to treat in a herd, when, according to what protocol and for how long, in order to maximise the probability of cure while minimising both the risk of drug resistance and the volume or number of doses that are necessary (i.e., individual-based and precision medicine).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Extracting information from massive data to monitor animal health and better rationalise treatments.</bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13567_2021_902_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par27">Nevertheless, alert quality depends on the quality and representativeness of the datasets used by the learning algorithms. Numerous biases (e.g., hardware, software, human) can affect prediction accuracy. Moreover, alerts produced after training necessarily reflect the specificities of the system from which the data originates (e.g., area, period, rearing practices). Thus, result transposition to other epidemiological systems or to the same system subjected to environmental or regulatory changes remains risky. Furthermore, while machine learning methods (e.g., classification, image analysis, pattern recognition, data mining) provide solutions for a wide range of biomedical and bio-health research questions, it is crucial to demonstrate the performance of these methods by measuring their predictive quality and comparing them to alternative statistical methods whenever possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">At the population level, case detection is based on direct (detection of syndromes) or indirect surveillance, mobilising syndrome proxies. Hence, the emergence of some animal diseases can be detected by syndromic surveillance, by detecting abnormal or rare signals in routine data (e.g., mortality, reproduction, abortion, behaviour, milk production, increased drug use; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]). Also, serological data can be used retrospectively to identify individual characteristics related to a risk of being exposed to a pathogen, and thus orientate management efforts (e.g., in wildlife; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]). Statistics and AI are largely complementary to address such issues. Both mobilise the wide range of available data, which are highly heterogeneous, massive and mostly sparse, to detect signals that are often weak or scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Such signals can be proxy records (e.g., emergence of infectious diseases following environmental disturbances), health symptoms and syndromes, or even metabolic pathways in cascades which can be precursors of chronic or degenerative diseases. AI also includes methods to mobilise information available on the web. For example, semi-automatic data mining methods enabled to identify emerging signals for international surveillance of epizooties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] or to analyse veterinary documents such as necropsy reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].

These movements are difficult to predict, particularly since animal trade is based on many factors associated with human activities and decisions. Methods for recognising spatio-temporal patterns and methodological developments for the analysis of oriented and weighted dynamic relational graphs are required in this field because very few of the existing methods allow large-scale systems to be studied, whereas datasets are often very large (e.g., several tens or even hundreds of thousands of interacting operations).</p><p id="Par30">On this topic, the specific frontier between learning methods of AI and statistics is relatively blurred, lying most on the relative prominence of the computational performance of algorithms versus mathematics, probability and rigorous statistical inference. While machine learning methods are more empirical, focused on improving their predictive performance, statistics is more concerned with the quantification and modelling of uncertainties and errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. In the last decade, both communities have started to communicate and to mix together. Methods have cross-fertilised, giving birth to statistical models using synthetic variables generated by AI methods, or AI algorithms optimising statistical measures of likelihood or quality.

However, most of the available models do not explicitly integrate human decision-making, while control decisions are often made by farmers (e.g., unregulated diseases), with sometimes large-scale health and decision-making consequences (e.g., pathogen spread, dissemination of information and rumours, area of influence).

Developing a library of models included in a common framework would strengthen the responsiveness of modellers in animal epidemiology. Relevant models would be developed more quickly and would gain accuracy from real-time modelling as epidemics progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. However, if this makes move more quickly from concepts (knowledge and assumptions) to simulations and support decision tools, a gain in performance is still required to perform analyses at a very large scale. The automatic generation of high-performance computer code could be a relevant solution, which however remains a crucial methodological lock to be addressed in AI. In addition, it is often required to perform a very large number of calculations or to analyse very large datasets, which call for a rational use of computing resources. Software transferred to health managers sometimes require the use of private cloud resources (i.e., it does not run on simple individual computers), highlighting the trade-offs between simulation cost, service continuity (e.g., failure management) and time required to obtain simulation results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. These questions are currently related to computer science research, and collaborations are desirable between these researchers and those from AH.</p><p id="Par34">Managers also wish to rely on accurate predictions from realistic representations of the biological systems. Before being used, model behaviour should be analysed, which raises the questions of exploring the space of uncertainties and data, and of optimization under constraints. This often requires intensive simulations, which would benefit from optimization algorithms to explore more efficiently the space of possibilities. In turn, this would allow, for example, the automatic identification of how to achieve a targeted objective (e.g., reducing the prevalence of a disease below an acceptable threshold) while being constrained in resource allocation. While this issue finds solutions in modern statistics for relatively simple systems, it represents a science front for complex systems (e.g., large scale, multi-host/multi-pathogen systems) that are becoming the norm. In addition, optimization goals specific to AH may generate ad hoc methodological needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. The needs in abstraction and analysis capacity are massive and could benefit from complementarities between AI (e.g., reasoned exploration, intelligent use of computer resources, optimized calculations) and statistics to extract as much information as possible from the data: (1) explore, analyse, predict; (2) infer processes and emergent properties. Methodological developments are still required and would benefit many health issues, particularly in relation to the currently evolving concepts of reservoir-host, edge-host and species barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Furthermore, methodological developments and dissemination of existing methods should be reinforced.</p><p id="Par35">Finally, three barriers have been identified to the development of support decision tools for health managers, related to the societal issue of the acceptability of AI sensu lato, as a major factor of progress. First, ethical issues, which are obvious when it comes to human health, are just as important to consider in AH. Which AI-based tools do we want for modern animal husbandries and trades, and for which objectives? Are these tools not likely to lead to discrimination against farms according to their health status, even when this status cannot be managed by the farmer alone? Second, in AH too, there is a fear that AI-tools may replace human expertise. However, automating does not mean replacing human, his expertise and decision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>], but rather supporting his capacities for abstraction and analysis, accelerating the global process, making predictions more reliable, guiding complementary research. Nevertheless, a significant development of computer resources and equipment is not without impacting the environment in terms of carbon footprint (e.g., energy-intensive servers, recycling of sensors), which must also be accounted for. Third, the very high complexity of analysing results and acculturating end-users with knowledge issued from academic research, particularly AI, is an obstacle to the appropriation of AI-tools by their users. This may lead to the preference for simpler and more easily accessible methods. However, the latter may not always be the most relevant or reliable. Citizen science projects, also known as community participation in human epidemiology, enable AH to co-design and co-construct the AI-tools of tomorrow with their end-users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], to better meet their expectations and needs, and to increase their confidence in the predictions of sometimes obscure research models, especially when they are hard to read (e.g., lines of code). Similarly, these AI-tools could be developed together with public decision-makers, livestock farmers, agro-food industries and sectoral trade unions. Co-construction gives time to explain the science behind the tools and makes it more transparent and useful. This citizen participation, which is nowadays supported in many countries, guarantees decisions more in line with citizens&#x02019; expectations and corresponds to a general trend towards structured decision-making. AI must contribute to this democratisation of aid in public decision-making in AH.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Barriers to the development of research at the AI/AH interface</title><p id="Par36">Research conducted at the interface between AI and AH requires strong interactions between biological disciplines (e.g., infectiology, immunology, clinical sciences, genetics, ecology, evolution, epidemiology, animal and veterinary sciences) and more theoretical disciplines (e.g., modelling, statistics, computer science), sometimes together with sociology and economics. Conducting research at this interface requires strengthening the few teams already positioned in Western Europe, but also bringing together teams working around the concepts of One Health, Ecohealth and Planetary Health to benefit from recent achievements in infectious disease ecology and modelling, plant health and environmental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>].

The need for research, training and support are crucial issues at national, European and international levels. Also, a facilitated and trusted connection is required between academics, technical institutes, and private partners, who are often the holders or collectors of data of interest to solve AH research questions through AI approaches. The construction of better inter-sectoral communication and coordination must be done at supra-institutional level, as this theme seems hyper-competitive and as some current divisions still go against information and data sharing.</p><p id="Par37">An acculturation of researchers to AI, its methods and potential developments, but also its limitations, must be proposed to meet the challenges of 21<sup>st</sup> century agriculture. Indeed, there are obstacles to conducting research on this scientific front. Establishing the new collaborations required between teams conducting methodological work and teams in the fields of application remains difficult given the low number of academic staff on these issues, their very high current mobilisation and their low availability to collaborate on new subjects, as well as the difficulty of understanding and mastering these methods. There is a need for watching and training on AI methods available or under development, new softwares/packages, and their applicability.

Skill development at this interface must be supported, the cross-fertilisation of disciplines being essential. A watch on methods must also be carried out, accompanied by explanations for application fields, to train researchers and engineers. Financial incentives for scientist internships in specialised laboratories would increase skill capitalisation in advanced methods, while facilitating future national or international collaborations. In a context of limited resources as observed in many countries nowadays (e.g., new opened positions in national institutions) and limited experts pool (e.g., skills), facilitating post-doctoral fellows and continuing education of researchers becomes crucial.

However, it is essential not to perceive massive data and AI as the same trend, because the accumulation of data does not always lead to an improvement in knowledge. Nevertheless, the more data are numerous and representative of working concepts and hypotheses, the more important results can be obtained from AI applications. The underlying ethical, deontological and legal aspects of data ownership, storage, management, sharing and interoperability also require that a reflection be undertaken nationally and internationally in AH to better manage these data of multi-sectoral origin and their various uses. Moreover, while the effort to acquire such data is impressive, the development of AI skills within the AH community remains limited in relation to the needs. Opportunities for collaborations with AI teams are limited because these teams are already in high demand. To ensure that AH researchers are well aware of the opportunities offered by AI, but also of the limits and constraints of AI approaches, a training effort must be provided and generalized.
