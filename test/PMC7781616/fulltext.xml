The bacterium can be isolated from aquatic environment, drinking water, , and even wastewater [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Diseases caused by pathogenic <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> in freshwater fish species result in millions of dollars of economic losses worldwide, which has affected the healthy development of freshwater aquaculture [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> was first reported as a human pathogen in 1968 [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since then, incidence of infections caused by pathogenic <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> has been on the rise because the bacterium can transmit to human through fish, water, or seafood exposed to <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> has become an emerging foodborne pathogen to human, and which associated with various infectious diseases from slight skin infections to life-threatened bacteremia [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The use of antibiotics is the main approach of controlling diseases caused by bacterial pathogens since which were introduced into aquaculture industry. However, antibiotic resistance has emerged because of the overuse of antibiotics, which has limited the application of antibiotics in fighting bacterial infections in aquaculture [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Treatment failure by antibiotics has led to call for novel drugs or strategies against resistant <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> infections.</p><p><italic>A. hydrophila</italic> harbors a number of virulence factors and toxins, including enterotoxin, cytotoxin, and toxins with hemolytic activities, which contribute to the pathogenesis of the bacterium [<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Aerolysin, purified from <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>, is a well-characterized pore-forming toxin with multiple activities, such as hemolytic, enterotoxic and cytotoxic activities [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Aerolysin is secreted as a soluble precursor (named proaerolysin) into supernatant and has no biological activity [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Maturation of proaerolysin to aerolysin with activity must cleave the flexible loop of 43-residue at C-terminus by furin, trypsin, or other proteases [<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Aerolysin can insert into target cell membrane after forming heptamer with a transmembrane pore [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The channel pore of the heptamer disrupts the membrane permeability barrier of cells and results in cell death [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Aerolysin has become a virulence marker of <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> because of the importance of the toxin [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, agents with anti- aerolysin activity might be useful for developing anti-<italic>A. hydrophila</italic> drugs.</p><p>Luteolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1(a</xref>)), a natural flavonoid compound, has been isolated from a number of herbal medicine including <italic>Perilla frutescens, Dendranthema indicum</italic> and <italic>Lonicera japonica</italic> Thunb. Luteolin exhibits a certain amount of biological activities, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective effects [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the present study, we found that luteolin could significantly reduce the pathogenesis of <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> by decreasing the activity of aerolysin.

Fish has become one of the most important sources of protein in China and perhaps other countries [<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, China has been the largest producer and consumer of aquaculture in the world, counting for approximately 60% of the global productions [<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the expansion of breeding scale results in the emergence of fish diseases and other problems [<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Among of which, bacterial infections have become the main obstruction to freshwater farming [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Epidemic disease caused by <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> has been reported, which may result in millions of dollars&#x02019; economic losses worldwide [<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Antibiotics have been extensively used in aquaculture for preventing or treating bacterial infections, including <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> infections [<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although the discovery and application of antibiotics decreased the loses caused by bacterial infections, several problems including antibiotic resistance and pollution have been observed [<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Moreover, the emergence of antibiotic resistance leads to treatment failure. Therefore, solutions are urgently demanded for dissolving the growing number of infectious diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Pore-forming toxins (PFTs), secreted by a large number of important bacterium, have been found that contributing to the virulence of bacterium [<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. PFTs are unique targets for identifying drugs battling with resistant bacterial pathogen infections because the presence of PFTs is nearly universal [<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Qiu et al. demonstrated that baicalin could reduce the activity of &#x003b1;-hemolysin of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) through binding to &#x003b1;-toxin and hindering the formation of functional heptamer, which resulted in the decrease of pathogenicity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to mice [<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Myricetin, a natural flavonoid compound, has been reported to be a candidate for the treatment of <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> by abolishing the activity of suilysin via inhibiting oligomer formation [<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Lu et al. found that betulin attenuated the virulence of <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> in a mice infection model by suppressing the oligomerization process of listeriolysin O (LLO) [<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that PFTs could be promising targets developing novel drugs against bacterial infections. Previous studies have shown that tannic acid and rosmarinic acid can inhibit the hemolytic activity of <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> by inhibiting the quorum sensing system, resulting in the reduction of bacterial pathogenesis [<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Moreover, T. Chakraborty et al. found that the 50% lethal dose of <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> strain deleted AerA was much higher than the wild type strain [<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These findings indicated that AerA is critical for the virulence of <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>. Thus, AerA has been employed as a target identifying anti-<italic>A. hydrophila</italic> drugs.</p><p>The purpose of traditional antibiotics is to kill the bacteria or to suppress the bacterial growth by inhibiting their essential functions [<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Although the modes of actions have been proven to be highly effective, the selective pressure has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Thus, compounds without anti-bacterial activities have been used for screening drugs to avoid the induction of resistance. Here we demonstrated that luteolin, had no influence on bacterial growth under our experimental concentrations, could decrease the hemolytic activity of AerA. Difference with our previous studies on thymol and magnolol, luteolin could directly neutralize the activity of AerA rather than affecting the production of AerA [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Moreover, indolo[3,2-<italic>b</italic>] quinolones have been identified as good candidates for anti-virulence drugs by inhibiting the activity of AerA like hemolysin of <italic>A. sobria</italic>. However, the mechanism and major binding sites were not determined by the authors [<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a promising tool for drug identification, have been widely applied to determine the binding modes and binding energies of ligand&#x02013;target interactions. Moreover, the increasing knowledge of structure and pore assembly of AerA makes it possible to clarify the mechanism of luteolin against the activity of AerA [<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our previous study confirmed that Arg356, Pro347 and Asn 37 were major binding sites of morin-AerA complex [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here, we found that Asp7 and Asp311 were major sites when determined by the same methods with morin. Although the binding sites were different, the two drugs shared the same mode of action by hindering the formation of heptamer. Previous study showed that the conformation of AerA would change in the process of forming heptamer, including the rotation of domain 1 and movement of domain 4 with respect to domain 3 [<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Taken our results together, these findings indicated that the binding of luteolin to AerA limited the movement of Asp7 and Asp 311 residues in conformation, which resulted in the barrier of forming heptamer. Of which might be the mechanism of luteolin inhibiting formation of heptamer. To obtain the results of oligomerization assay, the concentration of AerA used in the study was increased to 1 mg/mL, about 200-fold higher than the luteolin used in hemolytic activity assay. Thus, the mol ratio of luteolin and AerA was used to determine the concentration of luteolin in oligomerization assay. As expected, the production of heptamer was decreased following the addition of luteolin. Different with previous studies, Asp7 and Asp311 did not involve in the formation of heptamer directly (Supplemental Figure 2), we found that both the mutants could form heptamer in the absence of luteolin. However, there were still a certain amount of heptamer of the mutants in the presence of luteolin compared with WT-AerA plus luteolin (Supplemental Figure 2). The results indicated that AerA mutated Asp7 or Asp311 led to a decrease of binding ability.</p><p>A previous study showed that luteolin could serve as a potent anti-virulent agent against <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> mediated infections by inhibiting the quorum sensing system [<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Qiu et al. found that luteolin could reduce the product of &#x003b1;-toxin of <italic>S. aureus</italic> by inhibiting the <italic>agr</italic> locus [<xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Wang et al. reported that luteolin could reduce the LLO activity by binding to the <italic>hly</italic> mRNA coding region directly and their results demonstrated that luteolin could be used as a lead compound against <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infections [<xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These findings indicated that luteolin might be a novel agent against bacterial infections targeting the virulence. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report of luteolin on the pathogenicity of <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>. Overall, a new approach was developed in identifying drugs by inhibiting the activity of PFTs. Moreover, luteolin is a promising candidate against <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>-mediated infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM7105"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="KVIR_A_1867455_SM7105.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. Zhihong Liu from Sun Yat-sen University for kindly providing modeling software mentioned in the study.</p></ack><sec id="s0005" disp-level="1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No conflict of interest declared.</p></sec><sec id="s0006" disp-level="1"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>J.D. designed the experiments.
